stage1 contains arch specific assembler code that act as 'loaders'
Each loader is pretty simple, it consists of a few instructions that:
    - get current PC
    - read & patch relocation information in the binary code that follows the loader
    - jump to code 'entry point'

Those loaders assume that the memory layout is the following:

[loader code] [num relocs] [reloc1] [reloc2] ... [relocN] [start addr offset] [code]

The loader assumes that the code is zero-mapped which is to say that the first instruction thinks its own address is 0
The script build.py remaps the original section addresses to reflect that.
